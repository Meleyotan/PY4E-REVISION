# Exercise 1: Change the socket program socket1.py to prompt the user
# for the URL so it can read any web page. You can use split('/') to
# break the URL into its component parts so you can extract the host
# name for the socket connect call. Add error checking using try and
# except to handle the condition where the user enters an improperly
# formatted or non-existent URL.
